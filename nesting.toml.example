# TaskUI Nesting Configuration
# Copy this to ~/.taskui/nesting.toml and customize
#
# This file configures the hierarchical nesting behavior for TaskUI's two-column layout.
# TOML format is preferred for configuration due to better type safety and validation.

[nesting]
# Enable/disable nesting features globally
# When disabled, TaskUI reverts to flat list behavior
enabled = true

# Number of columns (currently fixed at 2, reserved for future use)
# Column 1 = Tasks (left), Column 2 = Subtasks (right)
num_columns = 2

[nesting.column1]
# Maximum nesting depth for Column 1 (Tasks)
# Level 0 = top-level, so max_depth=1 allows levels 0-1 (2 levels total)
# Default: 1 (matches current behavior)
#
# Examples:
#   max_depth = 0: Only top-level tasks (flat list)
#   max_depth = 1: Tasks can have child tasks (2 levels)
#   max_depth = 2: Tasks -> Child Tasks -> Grandchild Tasks (3 levels)
max_depth = 1

# Display name for this column
# Used in UI headers and error messages
display_name = "Tasks"

# Level-specific colors (hex format)
# Number of colors should be >= max_depth + 1
# These colors are used to visually distinguish hierarchy levels
level_colors = [
    "#66D9EF",  # Level 0 - Cyan (top-level tasks)
    "#A6E22E",  # Level 1 - Green (child tasks)
]

[nesting.column2]
# Maximum nesting depth for Column 2 (Subtasks)
# Default: 2 (matches current behavior, allows 3 levels)
#
# Column 2 typically shows children of the selected task from Column 1,
# so effective depth is relative to the selected task
max_depth = 2

# Display name for this column
display_name = "Subtasks"

# Level-specific colors (hex format)
# Three colors for three possible levels in Column 2
level_colors = [
    "#66D9EF",  # Level 0 - Cyan (immediate children)
    "#A6E22E",  # Level 1 - Green (grandchildren)
    "#F92672",  # Level 2 - Pink (great-grandchildren)
]

# Context-relative display: show children of selected task at level 0
# When true, Column 2 resets numbering relative to the selected task
# Example: If you select a Level 1 task, its children display as Level 0 in Column 2
# Default: true (matches current behavior)
context_relative = true

[nesting.validation]
# Strict validation: prevent creating tasks that exceed max depth
# When true, TaskUI will reject attempts to create tasks beyond max_depth
# When false, tasks beyond max_depth are allowed but may not display correctly
# Default: true (prevents data that violates configured limits)
strict_validation = true

# Show warnings when approaching max depth
# When true, TaskUI displays a warning when creating tasks at max_depth
# Helps users understand they've reached the nesting limit
# Default: true
warn_at_max_depth = true

[nesting.ui]
# Show level indicators in task items
# When true, displays visual indicators (colors, indentation) for hierarchy
# When false, uses minimal visual distinction
# Default: true
show_level_indicators = true

# Indentation spaces per level
# Number of spaces to indent each nesting level in the UI
# Higher values make hierarchy more obvious but reduce available space
# Default: 2 (balance between clarity and space)
indent_per_level = 2

# Tree line characters for hierarchy
# Enable tree-style lines connecting parent and child tasks
# Default: true
tree_line_enabled = true

# Character sequence for the last child in a group
# Default: "└─" (Unicode box drawing)
tree_line_last_child = "└─"

# Character sequence for middle children in a group
# Default: "├─" (Unicode box drawing)
tree_line_middle_child = "├─"
