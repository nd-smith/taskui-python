[sync]
# ============================================================================
# MULTI-COMPUTER SYNC VIA AWS SQS
# ============================================================================
# Sync task lists between multiple computers using AWS SQS message queues.
# Each change (task create/update/delete, list create/update) is queued locally
# and synced when manually triggered (Ctrl+Shift+S) or on app lifecycle events.
#
# SETUP REQUIREMENTS:
# 1. Create a NEW SQS queue named "taskui-sync" (SEPARATE from cloud_print queue)
# 2. Configure AWS credentials (aws configure or in [cloud_print] section)
# 3. Share the same encryption_key across all computers
# 4. Set enabled = true

# Enable/disable sync feature
enabled = false

# Sync mode: manual (only manual sync supported currently)
mode = manual

# Auto-sync triggers - when to automatically sync
sync_on_open = true      # Sync when app starts (pull remote changes)
sync_on_close = true     # Sync when app closes (push local changes)
sync_on_list_switch = false  # Reserved for future use

# SQS Queue Settings
# IMPORTANT: Use a SEPARATE queue from cloud_print!
# Create a new queue in AWS SQS Console named "taskui-sync"
# Queue type: Standard (not FIFO)
# Message retention: 14 days recommended
# Visibility timeout: 30 seconds recommended
queue_url = https://sqs.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID/taskui-sync
region = us-east-1

# ENCRYPTION: Reuses encryption_key from [cloud_print] section above
# IMPORTANT: All syncing computers MUST use the same encryption key!
# Generate a key with: python scripts/generate_encryption_key.py
#
# KEYBOARD SHORTCUT: Ctrl+Shift+S triggers manual sync
# STATUS BAR: Shows pending count, last sync time, and connection status

[nesting]
# TOML configuration is preferred for nesting features
# For full configuration options, see nesting.toml.example
# Simple INI-style fallback options below:

# Enable/disable nesting features globally
enabled = true

# Maximum nesting depth for Column 1 (Tasks)
# Default: 1 (allows 2 levels: parent and child)
column1_max_depth = 1

# Maximum nesting depth for Column 2 (Subtasks)
# Default: 2 (allows 3 levels relative to selected task)
column2_max_depth = 2

# Strict validation: prevent creating tasks that exceed max depth
strict_validation = true

# Show warnings when approaching max depth
warn_at_max_depth = true
